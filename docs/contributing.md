# Contributing

We welcome contributions to expand the available mount templates. You can find existing templates in the source code repository, which can serve as blueprints for creating new ones.

- **Existing Templates:** [GitHub](https://github.com/jsc-jupyter/jupyterlab-data-mount/tree/main/src/templates)
- **How to contribute:**
  1. Create your own mount template based on existing ones.
  2. Test it to ensure it works as expected. [Development](https://github.com/jsc-jupyter/jupyterlab-data-mount/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#contributing)
  3. Submit a Pull Request to the repository.

We appreciate community contributions to enhance the software!
